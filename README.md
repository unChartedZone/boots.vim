#vim-hybrid

Dark colorscheme for vim.

Use your favorite plugin manager for installation. I like [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

```vimscript
call plug#begin()
Plug 'scwood/vim-hybrid'
call plug#end()

syntax on
set background=dark
colorscheme hybrid
```

Original documentation found [here](https://github.com/w0ng/vim-hybrid).

I have modified a few highlight groups to have more contrast, including tab and status line colors.
